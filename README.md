## Project Motivation <a name="project-motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What time of year has the highest rental prices?
2. What factors have an influence on booking price ?
3. How well can we predict an host price?
4. What aspects correlate well to host earnings?
